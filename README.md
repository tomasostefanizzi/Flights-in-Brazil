![Airplane](images/flights.jpeg)

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing flight data from and to Brazil in the year 2020. The project aims to answer specific analytical questions by querying a dataset obtained from the website of the AgÃªncia Nacional de AviaÃ§Ã£o Civil (ANAC), Brazil's regulatory agency for civil aviation.

## Description

This assignment involves acquiring a dataset from an online source and conducting various queries to address chosen analytical questions. For this project, the focus is on analyzing flights to and from Brazil in the year 2020. The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on the website of the AgÃªncia Nacional de AviaÃ§Ã£o Civil (ANAC), the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing and regulating civil aviation activities within Brazil. Airlines are mandated to share several pieces of information with ANAC to ensure safety, compliance with regulations, and protection of both industry and passenger interests.

## Analytical Questions and Answers

The main focus of this project is to address specific analytical questions related to flights to and from Brazil in 2020, using three different techologies. Tha analytical questions I proposed are:
-   for each plane model,print some stats as it's avg speed, avg liters consumed etc.
-   list companies and their total distance traveled + total hours of flight
-   find all the routes in the database. also, count how many times they have been done.

For more details, check the [Report](Report.pdf). Enjoy :)!
