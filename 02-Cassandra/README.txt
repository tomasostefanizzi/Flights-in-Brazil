Important notes:
- The Original dataset was too large, but it's publically available at "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayconfelipemota/brazilian-data-flights"

- in the folder "data_cleaning" There are some Jupyter Notebooks for the data cleaning procedure.
- in the folder "data" there are both the (processed) csv files and there is also a dump for the database
- in the folder queries there are two files:
	-00_create_database.sql: it contains the set of queries in order to create the database (without the dump)
	-01_queries.sql: it contains the queries listed in the report
